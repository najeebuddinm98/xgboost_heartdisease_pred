# Heart Disease prediction using Gradient Boosted Trees

This project is my introduction to the XGBoost [2] library. Here, we use it to predict the probability of getting heart disease based on a patient's medical features. We use the [UCI Heart Disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) [1] for this purpose.
